    Do you remember <a href="">Open Labyrinth</a>?
    Now you inside the Dark Labyrinth and don't see the full map.
    But you have flashlight and all passages in the Labyrinth are directed along South-North and
    East-West lines. You don't know your position and where is the exit.
    And hurry - you can not run forever.
</p>

<p>
    This is a "multicall" mission and your function will be called until you in maze and have moves.
    For each iteration you see a part of the labyrinth in four directions. You can
    see passages and where they have crossings and turns. And you will see the exit if it will be
    in visible zone. Visible zone are represented as a grid as a tuple of strings,
    where
    <strong>
        "X" is a wall, "." is a passage cell, "?" is unknown, "P" is player and "E" is the exit.
    </strong>
    Grid are represented as 2D rectangular array. The size is related to visible zone size.
</p>
<p>
    For each iteration your function should return one or several actions as a string with
    directions.
    Actions are described as directions: "N" - North, "S" - South, "W" - West and "E" - East.
    So the string "NWS" describes a sequence of three moves.
    Don't move in a wall (there are weird slime on the walls).
    And you have ??? moves (not iterations).
    You can use global variables between iterations.

<p>
    For example on the image you can see the full labyrinth and that will be visible for player.
    And your function will receive:
        </p>
<pre>
("???XXX",
 "???...",
 "???X.X",
 "XXXX.X",
 "X...PX",
 "XXXX.X",
 "???X.X",
 "???...",
 "???X.X",
 "???X.X",
 "???..X",
 "???XXX")
</pre>

    <strong>Input: </strong> A visible part as a tuple of strings.
